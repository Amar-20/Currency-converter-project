# Notes.

## Api Link
```javaScript
url = https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/usd.json
```
[/We can change the last route part '/usd.json' and get the currency converstion of each country./]:#

[/We get 'string' in response in most of the Api calls. So, we need to handle it, by converting string format to json.(React query will handle it in default. ) /]:#
